# Quantum Principal Component Analysis (QPCA) Implementation Using Qiskit

This repository presents a formal implementation of the **Quantum Principal Component Analysis (QPCA)** algorithm using IBM's [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) framework. QPCA is a quantum analogue of classical Principal Component Analysis, designed to extract the principal components of quantum states. It is considered a promising approach in the field of quantum machine learning and quantum data compression.

## Overview

The implementation includes:
- Construction of quantum circuits simulating the QPCA algorithm  
- Preparation of quantum states representing covariance matrices  
- Application of Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) to extract eigenvalues  
- Comparative analysis with classical PCA for validation and benchmarking  

This project is intended for academic and research purposes, particularly for those exploring quantum algorithms and their applications in data science.

## Requirements

To run the code, the following dependencies are required:
- Python 3.8+
- Qiskit
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install qiskit numpy matplotlib
```

### Usage
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook:

git clone https://github.com/researchhub92/QPCA-Qiskit.git
cd QPCA-Qiskit
jupyter notebook qpca_circuit.ipynb
